------------------------------------------------

Version 0.1 (inital) for governor Version 0.8
---------------------------------------------

- idea and prototype version of this file by Yank555 (credits and thx!)
- added all currently available settings and added tuneables from governor version 0.8 to all available settings
- added version information variable and made changes for tuneable apply loop in governor
- added descriptions for all tuneables in profile (1)
- adjusted values for new features in all profiles
- added new settings:
  'zzbatp' (a new battery friendly but still fast setting)
  'zzmod'  (optimized based 2 core moderate setting)
  'zzinz'  (based on performance with insane scaling enabled)
  'zzgame' (based on performance with scaling block enabled)
- documentation added

Version 0.2 for governor Version 0.9 alpha1 (Yank555.lu)
--------------------------------------------------------

- split fast_scaling and fast_scaling_sleep into fast_scaling_up/fast_scaling_down
  and fast_scaling_sleep_up/fast_scaling_sleep_down

Version 0.2 alpha2 for governor Version 0.9 alpha2
--------------------------------------------------

- corrected documentation
- corrected version information
- added auto fast scaling step tuneables

Version 0.2 beta1 for governor Version 0.9 beta1
------------------------------------------------

- bump version to beta for public
- corrected version informations

Version 0.2 beta2 for governor Version 0.9 beta3
------------------------------------------------

- added values for following new tuneables (credits to ffolkes):
  hotplug_engage_freq (disabled by default in all profiles)
  scaling_fastdown_freq (disabled by default in all profiles)
  scaling_fastdown_up_threshold (default to 95 in all profiles)
  scaling_fastdown_down_threshold (default to 90 in all profiles)
  scaling_responsiveness_freq (disabled by default in all profiles)
  scaling_responsiveness_up_threshold (default to 30 in all profiles)
- adjusted up/down thresholds for core 2 in moderate setting
- changed sampling rate sleep multiplier from 4 to 6 in all settings (except in default setting)

Version 0.2 beta3 for governor Version 0.9 beta4
------------------------------------------------

- added scaling block temperature tuneable to all profiles if CONFIG_EXYNOS4_EXPORT_TEMP is defined
- use CPU temperature treshold of 65Â°C instead of 15 scaling block cycles in game profile if
  CONFIG_EXYNOS4_EXPORT_TEMP is defined
- added proportional frequency tuneable to all profiles
- added auto adjust freq thresholds to all profiles (disabled by default)
- enabled scaling proportional in ybat, ybatext, zzbat, zzbatp, zzmod and zzgame profile
- enabled scaling fast down over 1200MHz and resposiveness over 400Mhz with up threshold of 20%
  in ybat, ybatext, zzbat, zzbatp, and zzmod profile
- added core macros to exclude not used code like it is in governor
- removed freq_step tuneable from all profiles

Version 0.3 beta1 SNAP for governor Version 1.0 beta1
-----------------------------------------------------

- bump version to 0.3 beta1 because of brought forward plan 'outbreak'
- removed dynamic freq scaling tuneable leftovers
- added macros to switch code depending of used power management implementation
  or used supend/resume backlight hook (Snapdragon specific)
- added macros to disable hotplugging
- adjusted values in all profiles for Snapdragon devices (not optimized just compatible -> WIP)

Version 0.3 beta2 SNAP for governor Version 1.0 beta3
-----------------------------------------------------

- corrected/adjusted sampling rate values in settings where they were lower than the minimal possible value of 60000

Version 0.3 beta4 SNAP for governor Version 1.0 beta5
-----------------------------------------------------

- adjusted hotplug block values for native hotplugging and add scaling responsiveness settings to zzopt profile

Version 0.3 beta5 SNAP for governor Version 1.0 beta6
-----------------------------------------------------

- added hotplug stagger up/down tuneables to all profiles
- added hotplug up/down multiplier tuneables to all profiles
- added hotplug max/min/lock tuneables to all profiles

Version 0.3 beta6 SNAP for governor Version 1.0 beta6a (Andip71 aka Lord Boeffla)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- changed macro naming from CONFIG_BACKLIGHT_EXT_CONTROL to USE_LCD_NOTIFIER accordingly to
  governor version 1.0 beta6a
- version information in profiles file version variable corrected

Version 0.3 beta7 SNAP for governor Version 1.0 beta7 (sync)
------------------------------------------------------------

- added PROFILE_MAX_FREQ definition for freq adaption functionality:
  this should hold the maximal possible freq (possible OC frequencies inclusive)
  for all the given profiles
- added music min/max freq and music max cores tuneables to all profiles
- setup default values for music* and inputbooster* tuneables in all profiles
- reduced all hotplug block values to a minimum for faster hotplug reaction in all profiles
- added new 'relax' profile with relaxed sleep settings and a forced 2 cores minimal hotplug setting
- some documentation corrected

Version 0.3 beta8 SNAP for governor Version 1.0 beta8
-----------------------------------------------------

- sampling_rate_sleep_multiplier lowered from factor 6 to 4 in all profiles where it was set (to react device wakeup issues)
- exchanged all 'OPO (One Plus One)' references with 'SNAP (Snapdragon)'
- added 'ENABLE_AUTO_ADJUST_FREQ' and 'ENABLE_MUSIC_LIMITS' macros
- added missing hotplug multipliers to all profile settings
- fixed little mess in all hotplug threshold macros
- tagged all #endifs for better 'sight'
